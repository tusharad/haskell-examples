# haskell-examples

Haskell is statically typed, purely functional programming language. Despite being so good, One of the biggest problem, newcomers face while learning haskell is the lack tutorials/documenation. The online learning resource for haskell is quite low, compared with other languages such as Java, Python etc. Hence, I am buiilding repo, containing concept-wise examples, which will new programmers to learn the language as well as experinced haskell programmers can use this as a reference mannual.

I will also try to write theory in each section's `README`.
