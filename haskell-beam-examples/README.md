# haskell-beam-examples

In this project, I have used the Beam library to interact with a PostgreSQL database. I have created a simple example to demonstrate how to use Beam to interact with a PostgreSQL database.

## What is ORM?

ORM stands for object relational mapping. It is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. It creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language. There are both free and commercial packages available that perform object relational mapping, although some programmers opt to construct their own ORM tools.

## What is Beam?

Beam is a database library for haskell. It is a type-safe, non-TH, and high-performance way to interact with databases. It is a modern Haskell SQL library and a type-safe, non-TH way to interact with databases. It is a type-safe, non-TH, and high-performance way to interact with databases. It is a modern Haskell SQL library and a type-safe, non-TH way to interact with databases.
