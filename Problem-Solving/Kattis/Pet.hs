In the popular show “Dinner for Five”, five contestants
    compete in preparing culinary delights. Every evening one of
    them makes dinner and each of other four then grades it on a
    scale from 1 to 5. The number of points a contestant gets is
    equal to the sum of grades they got. The winner of the show is
    of course the contestant that gets the most points. Write a program that determines the winner and how many
    points they got. Five lines, each containing 4 integers, the grades a
    contestant got. The contestants are numbered 1 to 5 in the
    order in which their grades were given. Output on a single line the winner’s number and their
    points, separated by a space. The input data will guarantee
    that the solution is unique.
