# Guards
 
Guards are used for control flow structure in haskell. Guards are pretty similar to if-else. I will be adding case-expressions in this file itself, considering they all are pretty similar.
Other ways of conditional flow in haskell is pattern-matching, but will get to that later.

## Case Expressions

Case expressions are similar to if-then-else. You can use case expression, when there are many cases of arugments you want to perform operation on.
